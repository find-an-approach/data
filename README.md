Pulls from faa-instrument-approach-db and publishes as a gh-page

This repo is mostly just here so we don't clutter up the main repo https://github.com/find-an-approach/find-an-approach.github.io
by pushing the `approaches.json` files here. Instead a workflow in this repo downloads the latest one from
https://github.com/ammaraskar/faa-instrument-approach-db and puts it here so it can be used by the website.
